## Features

- Elegant typography with a romantic flair  
- Smoky animated text with glowing effects  
- Heartbeat-style background animation using `canvas`  
- Smooth, infinite animation loops

## How It Works

The animation uses a combination of CSS for text blur and glowing effects, and JavaScript to animate a pulsing heart on the canvas. Each letter of the message animates with a delay to give a smoky, wave-like motion.

1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.  
3. Customize the message in the `.smoke` div.  
4. Modify colors, fonts, or animation speeds in `style.css` if needed.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3

## Customization
You can easily change:
- The message text inside `index.html`
- The font style by switching the Google Font
- The color palette and animation blur levels in `style.css`
- The canvas animation logic in `script.js`
